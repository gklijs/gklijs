<article class="markdown-body entry-content container-lg" itemprop="text"><p>I've been doing Java for most of my career, but also doing Clojure and Rust in my free time, and dabbled a bit with
    Node.js and Kotlin. I have most experience with REST API's but also used GraphQL in production and passion projects.
    Recently I build a POC's with gRPC.</p>
    <p>I've presented on using GraphQL with Apache Kafka at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN73NiR8xZI" rel="nofollow">GraphQL Summit 2019</a>.
        I'm trying to write more blogs, I've written some at <a href="https://dev.to/gklijs" rel="nofollow">Dev.to</a>, and one for Confluent
        about <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/getting-started-with-rust-and-kafka/" rel="nofollow">Using Rust with Kafka</a>.</p>
    <p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/GKlijs" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>
        and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerard-klijs-416b3744/" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. Currently I'm working
        for <a href="https://www.openweb.nl/" rel="nofollow">Open Web</a>, as this is mostly a consultancy company, I work for several companies via them,
        currently for the Dutch national police.</p>

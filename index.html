    <p>
        I've been doing Java and Kotlin for most of
        my career. Doing Clojure and Rust in my free time, and dabbled a bit with Node.js.
        I have experience with several types of API's. Using REST based on OpenAPI, GraphQL, and async API's based on
        Kafka in formats like Protobuf and Cloud Events.
        For <a href="https://github.com/gklijs/bkes" rel="nofollow">BKES</a> I used gRPC.
        I created and maintain a Rust library to use schema registry
        <a href="https://crates.io/crates/schema_registry_converter" rel="nofollow">schema_registry_converter</a>.

        I've presented on using GraphQL with Apache Kafka at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN73NiR8xZI"
                                                                rel="nofollow">GraphQL Summit 2019</a>.
        I also presented at Kafka Summit 2020 and Kafka Summit 2021, and some others.
        I'm trying to write more blogs, I've written some at <a href="https://dev.to/gklijs" rel="nofollow">Dev.to</a>.
        There are also two blogs I wrote in cooperation with Confluent,
        <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/getting-started-with-rust-and-kafka/" rel="nofollow">
            using Rust with Kafka</a> and
        <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/intro-to-graphql-an-api-for-kafka-data/" rel="nofollow">
            using GraphQL with Kafka</a>. There is also one about the background of the Rust library on the
        <a href="https://blog.openweb.nl/blog/confluent-schema-registry-and-rust" rel="nofollow">
            Open Web blog page</a>.

        and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerard-klijs-416b3744/" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. Currently I'm
        working
        for <a href="https://www.openweb.nl/" rel="nofollow">Open Web</a>, as this is mostly a consultancy company, I
        work for several companies via them,

        As you might have guessed frontend isn't my strong suit. I do plan to have something more fancy at some time in
        the future trough. Likely using <a href="https://bulma.io/" rel="nofollow">Bulma</a> just like for the
        <a href="https://www.pokequiz.gklijs.tech/" rel="nofollow">pokequiz</a> I once made.

# Github profile page for Gerard Klijs

I've been doing Java and Kotlin for most of my career. Doing Clojure and Rust in my free time, and dabbled a bit with
Node.js. I have experience with several types of API's. Using REST based on OpenAPI, GraphQL, and async API's based on
Kafka in formats like Protobuf and Cloud Events. For [BKES](https://github.com/gklijs/bkes) I used gRPC. I created and
maintain a Rust library to use schema
registry [schema_registry_converter](https://crates.io/crates/schema_registry_converter).

I've presented on using GraphQL with Apache Kafka at [GraphQL Summit 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN73NiR8xZI).
I also presented at Kafka Summit 2020 and Kafka Summit 2021, and some others. I'm trying to write more blogs, I've
written some at [Dev.to](https://dev.to/gklijs). There are also two blogs I wrote in cooperation with
Confluent, [using Rust with Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/blog/getting-started-with-rust-and-kafka/)
and [using GraphQL with Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/blog/intro-to-graphql-an-api-for-kafka-data/). There is also one
about the background of the Rust library on
the [Open Web blog page](https://blog.openweb.nl/blog/confluent-schema-registry-and-rust).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GKlijs)
and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerard-klijs-416b3744/). Currently I'm working
for [Open Web](https://www.openweb.nl/), as this is mostly a consultancy company, I work for several companies via them,
currently for [Mendix](https://www.mendix.com/company/), a low code platform.

As you might have guessed frontend isn't my strong suit. I do plan to have something more fancy at some time in the
future trough. Likely using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) just like for the [pokequiz](https://www.pokequiz.gklijs.tech/) I
once made.

I've been doing Java for most of my career, but also doing Clojure and Rust in my free time, and dabbled a bit with
Node.js and Kotlin. I have most experience with REST API's but also used GraphQL in production and passion projects.
Recently I build a POC's with gRPC.

I've presented on using GraphQL with Apache Kafka at [GraphQL Summit 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN73NiR8xZI).
I'm trying to write more blogs, I've written some at [Dev.to](https://dev.to/gklijs), and one for Confluent
about [Using Rust with Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/blog/getting-started-with-rust-and-kafka/).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GKlijs)
and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerard-klijs-416b3744/). Currently I'm working
for [Open Web](https://www.openweb.nl/), as this is mostly a consultancy company, I work for several companies via them,
currently for the Dutch national police.
